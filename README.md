# The problem Envision solves
In the hustle and bustle of today's life, we are taking care of ourselves but failing to take care of nature. With the help of Envision,
you can find out the daily activities that will enable you to take care of both yourself and nature. Explaining with an example,
let's say you have leftover food from the entire day. Normally, you might just throw it away, but Envision will suggest ways in which
your food doesn't become extra or go to waste. It will recommend giving it to stray animals during the night or inform you about NGOs that you can donate the food to.

# Steps
